        <li>1/2 cup fresh cream or milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>For the Koftas:</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, grated paneer, boiled mixed vegetables, cornflour, garam masala, cumin powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well to form a dough-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into small portions and shape them into round balls (koftas).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully drop the koftas into the oil and fry them until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Set aside.</li>
        <li>For the Gravy:</li>
        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, and garam masala. Mix well and cook for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato puree and cook until the oil starts to separate from the masala.</li>
        <li>Add the cashew nut paste and mix well. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add fresh cream or milk to the gravy and mix well. Cook for another 2-3 minutes. If the gravy is too thick, you can add a little water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste and mix well. Simmer the gravy for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently add the fried koftas to the gravy just before serving. Be careful not to stir too much as the koftas can break apart.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with naan, roti, or rice.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade Malai Kofta!</li>
